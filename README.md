📱 **Responsive** - Works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 20** - Latest Angular with standalone components and signals
- **Angular Material** - Material Design UI components
- **RxJS 7** - Reactive programming for async operations
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **SCSS** - Enhanced styling with variables and nesting

## Project Architecture

This project follows Angular best practices with a **feature-based architecture**:

```
src/app/
├── core/          # Core services and models
├── shared/        # Shared components (header, etc.)
└── features/      # Feature modules
    ├── games/     # Game browsing and library
    └── reviews/   # Review components
```

For detailed architecture information, see [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

## Angular Best Practices

This project demonstrates:

✅ Feature-based architecture  
✅ Standalone components (no NgModules)  
✅ Lazy-loaded routes  
✅ Signal-based reactivity  
✅ RxJS for async operations  
✅ TypeScript strict mode  
✅ Component isolation  
✅ Material Design patterns  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Accessibility considerations  

## Current State

The application currently uses **mock data** for demonstration purposes. All data is stored in-memory via the `GameService`. This makes it easy to:
- Test the UI and features
- Demonstrate functionality
- Plan backend integration
