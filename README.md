## Project Architecture

This project follows Angular best practices with a **feature-based architecture**:

```
src/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Core services and models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/        # Shared components (header, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features/      # Feature modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ games/     # Game browsing and library
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reviews/   # Review components
```

For detailed architecture information, see [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md).

## Angular Best Practices

This project demonstrates:

‚úÖ Feature-based architecture  
‚úÖ Standalone components (no NgModules)  
‚úÖ Lazy-loaded routes  
‚úÖ Signal-based reactivity  
‚úÖ RxJS for async operations  
‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode  
‚úÖ Component isolation  
‚úÖ Material Design patterns  
‚úÖ Responsive design  
‚úÖ Accessibility considerations  

## Current State

The application currently uses **mock data** for demonstration purposes. All data is stored in-memory via the `GameService`. This makes it easy to:
- Test the UI and features
- Demonstrate functionality
- Plan backend integration
